protocols
=========

This is an experment with writing hardware protocols in FRP.

We are attempting

  * Debounce
  * RS232
  * I2C
  * Wishbone
  * [Sitronix ST7066U Dot Matrix LCD controller](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/LCD/st7066.pdf) (We used this in our patches paper)

We would like to understand the issues of adding hard-realtime contraints, and how we might map FRP to
hardware and embedded software.
We are also interested in understanding more about transactions as a concept, and how they fit into FRP.
