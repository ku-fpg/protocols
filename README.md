protocols
=========

This is an experment with writing hardware protocols in FRP.

We are attempting

  * Debounce
  * RS232
  * I2C
  
We would like to understand the issues of adding hard-realtime contraints, and how we might map FRP to hardware and embedded software.

We are also interested in understanding more about transactions as a concept, and how they fit into FRP.
